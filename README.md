# 📝 Task Manager System

A **simple and efficient task management system** built with **Python**, developed during the **Samsung Innovation Campus (SIC)** course.  
It supports adding, deleting, updating, and viewing tasks with various attributes like deadlines, priorities, and more.

> 🛠️ Also packaged as an `.exe` file using **PyInstaller**, making it easy to run on any Windows machine without Python.

## 🚀 How to Run

### ▶️ Option 1: Run with Python

Make sure Python is installed on your system (Python 3.10+ recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammedElEsh/SIC_Project_2.git
cd SIC_Project_2
python Project_2.py
```

> ✅ Make sure `Project_2_json.json` exists in the same folder before starting.

### 🖥️ Option 2: Run `.exe` (No Python needed)

If you prefer to run the executable version:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Double-click on `Project_2.exe` to start the application.

> ✅ Ensure all necessary files are in the same directory as the executable.
